title Integrative Modeling using IMP - Activity Diagram 


start

:<b>Stage 1</b> - Gathering of data;
note right
 https://integrativemodeling.org/tutorials/rnapolii_stalk/
end note

while (Artifacts collation for IM complete ?)  is (No)
 :IMP module in MassSpecStudio - Wizard;
 fork
  :Chemical crosslinking datasets ( .csv format);
 fork again
  :With Sequence information (FASTA files for each subunit) ;
 fork again
  :Electron density maps (.mrc, .txt files);
 fork again
  :High resolution structure from x-ray crystallography (PDB file);
 end fork 
 
endwhile (Yes)

:<b>Stage 2</b> - Representation of subunits and translation of the data into spatial restraints;
 fork
  :Prepare YAML config for modeling python script;
 fork again 
  :Build the Model Representation Using a Topology File;
  note right
    ""define the system components and their representation parameters""
    ====
    The calculation of the GMM of a subunit can be done automatically in the topology file
  end note
  :Building the System Representation and Degrees of Freedom ;
  note right
    ""After defining the representation of the model""
    ====
    we build the restraints by which the individual structural models will be scored based on the input data;
  end note
  :convert the data into spatial restraints (with modeling python script);
 end fork 
 
:<b>Stage 3</b> - Sampling;
 fork
  :First, sampling parameters are set;
  note right
   ""With the system representation built and data restraints entered""
   ====
   the system is now ready to sample configurations
  end note
  :Next, a replica exchange run can be set up;
 end fork

:<b>Stage 4</b> - Analysis;

 fork
  :Part 1;
  note right
    ""In the analysis stage we cluster (group by similarity) the sampled models""
    ====
    to determine high-probability configurations. Comparing clusters may indicate 
    that there are multiple acceptable configurations given the data
  end note
  :Part 2;
  note right
    ""In this stage we perform post-clustering analysis""
  end note
 end fork
